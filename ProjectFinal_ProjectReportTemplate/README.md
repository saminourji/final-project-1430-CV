# Final Project Report Template
This directory contains the files for your team to complete the Final Project Report.

We recommend you begin by reading through `ProjectFinal_ProjectReportTemplate.tex` on Overleaf to see how everything is formatted and written. The placeholder texts and comments within the file contain guidelines on how to insert specific items such as tables and figures.

To build your bibliography, please also refer to the `ProjectFinal_ProjectReportTemplate.bib` file. Some sample citations are already given; please replace these with the articles you use.

Please feel free to play around with the templates and adjust the content to fit your project!
